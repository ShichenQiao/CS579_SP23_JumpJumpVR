# CS579 SP23 Final Project - JumpJumpVR

**Project Demo</br>**
TBD</br>

**Summary</br>**
In this project, we designed an original, immersive, and creative Virtual Reality game with the Unity Game Engine. Players are expected to do physical squats while wearing the Meta Quest 2 VR headset to charge their virtual avatar for long jumps between moving platforms. The winning condition is overcoming the backward movement of the platforms and reaching a destination on the other end of the buildings under limited times. The users have to squat frequently to prevent from falling off the moving platform they stand on, which makes the game not only entertaining but also an effective workout. Developing this game entails substantial C# scripting, 3D modeling, original asset creations, physics engine collaborations, and deploying the executable.
